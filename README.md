# VirtualPianoBot
A simple bot that can play any song, with only adjusting time.sleep() for pacing per song, used on VirtualPiano but could be used in other games without DirectX. If you do have a game with DirectX, you will struggle with using pydirectinput...

To use this, you need to save a music sheet in a .txt file and type in the name (including .txt) when prompted. Make sure the file is in the same directory as the Python File.
