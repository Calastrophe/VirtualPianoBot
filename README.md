# VirtualPianoBot
A simple bot that can play any song, (without |  for now) with only adjusting time.sleep() for pacing, used on VirtualPiano but could be used in other games with a similar piano.

To use this, you need to save a music sheet in a .txt file and type in the name (including .txt) when prompted. Make sure the file is in the same directory as the Python File.
